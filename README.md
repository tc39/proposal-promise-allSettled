## Overview and motivation

A common use case that I and many others come across, is to want to settle all promises within an array. Due to the short circuit nature of `Promise.all()` any rejected promise will make the resulting promise reject while silently discarding other results.
The key feature of the `.allSettled()` method is that it allows us to settle all promises.

`Promise.allSettled()` returns a promise that is fulfilled with an array of promise state snapshots, but only after all the original promises have settled, i.e. become either fulfilled or rejected.

This method is used in its static form on arrays of promises, in order to execute a number of operations concurrently and be notified when they all finish, regardless of success or failure.

## Why `allSettled`?

We say that a promise is _settled_ if it is not pending, i.e. if it is either fulfilled or rejected. See [_promise states and fates_](https://github.com/domenic/promises-unwrapping/blob/master/docs/states-and-fates.md) for more background on the relevant terminology.

Furthermore, the name `allSettled` is commonly used in userland libraries implementing this functionality. See below.

## Examples

Currently you would need to iterate through the array of promises and return a new value with the status known (either through the resolved branch or the rejected branch.

```js
function reflect(promise) {
  return promise.then(
    (v) => {
      return { status: 'fulfilled', value: v };
    },
    (error) => {
      return { status: 'rejected', reason: error };
    }
  );
}

const promises = [ fetch('index.html'), fetch('https://does-not-exist/') ];
const results = await Promise.all(promises.map(reflect));
const successfulPromises = results.filter(p => p.status === 'fulfilled');
```

The proposed API allows a developer to handle these cases without creating a reflect function and/or assigning intermediate results in temporary objects to map through:

```js
const promises = [ fetch('index.html'), fetch('https://does-not-exist/') ];
const results = await Promise.allSettled(promises);
const successfulPromises = results.filter(p => p.status === 'fulfilled');
```

Collecting errors example:

Here we are only interested in the promises which failed, and thus collect the reasons. `allSettled` allows us to do this quite easily.

```js
const promises = [ fetch('index.html'), fetch('https://does-not-exist/') ];

const results = await Promise.allSettled(promises);
const errors = results
  .filter(p => p.status === 'rejected')
  .map(p => p.reason);
```

### Real-world scenarios

A common operation is knowing when all requests have completed regardless of the state of each request. This allows developers to build with progressive enhancement in mind. Not all API responses will be mandatory.

Without `Promise.allSettled` this is tricker than it could be:

```js
const urls = [ /* ... */ ];
const requests = urls.map(x => fetch(x)); // Imagine some of these will fail, and some will succeed.

// Short-circuits on first rejection, all other responses are lost
try {
  await Promise.all(requests);
  console.log('All requests have completed; now I can remove the loading indicator.');
} catch {
  console.log('At least one request has failed, but some of the requests still might not be finished! Oops.');
}
```

Using `Promise.allSettled` would be more suitable for the operation we wish to perform:

```js
// We know all API calls have finished. We use finally but allSettled will never reject.
Promise.allSettled(requests).finally(() => {
  console.log('All requests are completed: either failed or succeeded, I donâ€™t care');
  removeLoadingIndicator();
});
```
